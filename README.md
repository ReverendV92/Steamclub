### A Steampunk-Themed Bar

An old map made by gm_Jimmy c.2011, this is a small map meant for posing with a steampunk theme.
I have made some edits to optimize the map, and packed the custom content loose into the add-on so it can be spawned manually. I have included a navigation mesh & node graph, albeit these are more of a token measure as the play area is a small & compact area.
